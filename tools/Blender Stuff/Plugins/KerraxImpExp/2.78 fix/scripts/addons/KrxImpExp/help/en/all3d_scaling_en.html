<h3>Scaling</h3>

<p>The scale value is a number of system units of length per 1 file unit. In good .3ds and .asc files coordinates and distances are written in centimeters , therefore file unit is centimeter. If you change system unit the scale value will be changed automatically. For example, if you want to edit a model in meters, change system unit to "meter", and scale will be equal to 0.01 (0.01 is a number of meters in one centimeter).</p>

<p><b>2.</b> When you are exporting a file you can setup scale value which will be used for writing the file. To do it, click the "Scale" button and change scale value. The scale value is a number of file units of length per 1 system unit. For example, if you measure distances in meters when you are editing your model you have to set the scale value to 100 (100 is a number of centimeters ("file units") in one meter).
